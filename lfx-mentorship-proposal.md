### üìö Background & Motivation

**Why I'm interested in this project:**
I am excited about contributing to CloudNativePG's reliability through chaos engineering. This project combines my interests in:
- Database systems and PostgreSQL
- Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies
- Testing and reliability engineering
- Open-source contribution

**My relevant experience:**
*[Customize based on your background]*
- Experience with Kubernetes (even basic knowledge counts!)
- Any database experience (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Programming in Go (or willingness to learn)
- Testing experience (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- Any chaos engineering or reliability testing exposure

### üéØ Project Understanding

**What is CloudNativePG?**
CloudNativePG (CNPG) is like a smart manager for PostgreSQL databases running in Kubernetes. Think of it as:
- **The Database**: PostgreSQL stores your important data
- **The Platform**: Kubernetes runs your applications in containers
- **The Operator**: CNPG automatically manages PostgreSQL in Kubernetes

**Why Chaos Testing?**
Imagine you're running a critical database for an e-commerce site. What happens if:
- The main database suddenly crashes?
- Network issues prevent databases from talking to each other?
- A disk becomes slow or fails?

Chaos testing intentionally causes these problems in a controlled way to ensure the system can handle them gracefully.

### üí° The Problem We're Solving

Currently, CloudNativePG needs better testing for failure scenarios. We want to answer questions like:
1. **Does automatic failover work?** When the primary database fails, does a backup take over quickly?
2. **Is data safe during failures?** Do we lose any data during network problems?
3. **How fast is recovery?** How quickly does the system return to normal?

### üöÄ Proposed Solution

I propose building a comprehensive chaos testing framework with three main components:

#### 1. **Core Framework** (Weeks 1-3)
A foundation that manages chaos experiments safely:

```go
// Example: Simple chaos experiment structure
type ChaosExperiment struct {
    Name        string        // "test-primary-failure"
    Target      string        // Which database to affect
    Action      string        // What to do (kill, delay, etc.)
    Duration    time.Duration // How long to run
    SafetyCheck func() bool   // Is it safe to continue?
}
```

**What this does**: Provides the basic building blocks for all chaos tests.

#### 2. **Chaos Experiments Library** (Weeks 4-7)
Specific tests for PostgreSQL scenarios:

**Pod Failures** (Week 4)
- Kill the primary database pod
- Verify a replica takes over
- Ensure no data loss

**Network Problems** (Week 5)
- Simulate network delays between databases
- Create network partitions (split-brain scenarios)
- Test replication under poor network conditions

**Storage Issues** (Week 6)
- Slow disk I/O operations
- Disk space exhaustion
- Write failures

**Resource Stress** (Week 7)
- High CPU usage
- Memory pressure
- Combined resource constraints

#### 3. **Safety & Observability** (Weeks 8-10)
Making chaos testing safe and measurable:

**Safety Controller**
```go
// Stops chaos if things go wrong
if databaseUnhealthy() || dataAtRisk() {
    stopChaosImmediately()
    alertOperators()
}
```

**Metrics Collection**
- Time to detect failure (TTD)
- Time to recover (TTR)
- Data consistency checks
- Performance impact measurements

#### 4. **Integration & Documentation** (Weeks 11-12)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example test scenarios
- Runbook for operators
